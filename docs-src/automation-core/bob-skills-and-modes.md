# Bob<span style="color:#0f62fe">+</span> Skills and Modes – Automation

IBM Bob ships with purpose-built **Skills** and **Custom Modes** for every Automation building block, giving engineers an AI-assisted workflow to plan, build, configure, and operate infrastructure, security, and optimization capabilities directly from their IDE.

## How to install the Skills
The Skills have been packed into a single .zip that you can easily download and install. Go to the [skills.zip page](https://github.com/ibm-self-serve-assets/building-blocks/blob/main/ibm-bob/skills.zip) and click the `Download raw file` icon at the upper-right of the page.  Copy all skill folders at either the global, `~/.bob/skills`, or project-level, `<project>/.bob/skills`

## Skill Taxonomy

Each Skill for IBM Building Blocks often aligns with an IBM product but not always.  For specifics on how each skill works, read through the associated SKILL.md.
