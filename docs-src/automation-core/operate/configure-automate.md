# Configure & Automate

## Overview

Configure & Automate delivers enterprise-grade configuration management, application deployment, and IT automation through Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform—enabling organizations to enforce consistent state across hybrid infrastructure at scale without deploying agents.

### What is Configure & Automate?

Modern enterprises operate thousands of servers, containers, and network devices across on-premises data centers and multiple cloud providers. Keeping this infrastructure consistently configured, patched, and compliant requires automation that scales with the environment. **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform** provides that foundation: an agentless, YAML-based automation framework that connects to any infrastructure over SSH or WinRM and executes idempotent playbooks to bring systems into the desired state.

This building block is designed for platform engineers, SREs, and DevOps teams who need to standardize application deployments, automate routine operational tasks, and integrate automation into CI/CD pipelines. By treating configuration as code, teams can version-control their automation, enforce governance through Automation Controller (formerly Tower), and share reusable roles through Ansible Galaxy and Private Automation Hub.

### Why Configure & Automate?

- **🤖 Agentless Architecture**: Connect to any host over SSH or WinRM—no agent installation or maintenance overhead
- **📝 Human-Readable Automation**: YAML-based playbooks that are easy to write, review, and maintain
- **🔁 Idempotent Execution**: Run playbooks safely multiple times; only changes needed are applied
- **🏢 Enterprise Governance**: Automation Controller provides RBAC, audit logging, and centralized job scheduling
- **🔗 Extensive Integration**: 3,000+ certified modules covering cloud, network, containers, and applications
- **🚀 CI/CD Ready**: Native integration with Jenkins, GitLab CI, Tekton, and other pipeline tools

### Real-World Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Enterprise-Scale OS Patching

**Challenge**: A financial institution needs to apply critical security patches to 5,000 Linux servers within a 48-hour compliance window without causing service outages.

**Solution**: Ansible rolling update playbooks patch servers in batches, run health checks between batches, and automatically pause if a check fails—all orchestrated from Automation Controller with full audit logs.

**Results**:
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>Scale</strong>: 5,000 servers patched within the compliance window</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Safety</strong>: Zero service outages through rolling batch execution</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Compliance</strong>: Complete audit trail satisfying regulatory requirements</li>
</ul>

#### Scenario 2: Self-Service Environment Provisioning

**Challenge**: Developer teams wait days for environment provisioning requests to be fulfilled by operations teams, slowing delivery velocity.

**Solution**: Automation Controller survey forms let developers self-provision environments by selecting parameters. Ansible playbooks handle the actual provisioning and configuration within minutes.

**Benefits**:
<ul>
<li>Environment provisioning time reduced from days to under 30 minutes</li>
<li>Operations team freed from routine provisioning requests</li>
<li>Consistent environment configuration across all developer environments</li>
</ul>

## Core Concepts

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Concept 1: Idempotency

Ansible playbooks are designed to be idempotent—running the same playbook multiple times produces the same result without side effects. If a system is already in the desired state, Ansible makes no changes.

**Key Points:**
- Safe to re-run playbooks for drift remediation
- Each task checks current state before making changes
- `changed` vs `ok` status clearly shows what was modified

#### Concept 2: Inventory

Ansible's inventory defines the managed hosts and groups them logically. Dynamic inventory plugins auto-discover hosts from cloud providers, CMDBs, and container platforms.

```yaml
# Static inventory example
[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[databases]
db1.example.com ansible_user=dbadmin
```

#### Concept 3: Roles and Collections

Roles bundle related tasks, variables, templates, and handlers into a reusable unit. Collections package multiple roles, modules, and plugins into a distributable artifact.

```
roles/
  webserver/
    tasks/main.yml
    templates/nginx.conf.j2
    vars/main.yml
    handlers/main.yml
```
