# Infrastructure as Code

## Overview

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an enterprise automation framework that enables repeatable, auditable, and scalable infrastructure provisioning through declarative code and state management.

### What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code transforms infrastructure management from manual, error-prone processes into automated, version-controlled workflows. This building block uses **HashiCorp Terraform** to provision and manage cloud and on-premises infrastructure as software artifacts—enabling platform engineers and cloud architects to apply development best practices such as version control, code review, testing, and continuous integration to infrastructure management.

The solution addresses the complexity of managing dynamic, distributed cloud-native environments where manual processes cannot scale. Whether provisioning OpenShift clusters, deploying networking resources, or managing multi-environment configurations, Infrastructure as Code accelerates delivery while maintaining consistency, governance, and auditability across the entire infrastructure lifecycle.

### Why Infrastructure as Code?

- **🏗️ Declarative Infrastructure Provisioning**: Define infrastructure state in code with Terraform for predictable, repeatable deployments
- **🔄 Environment Consistency**: Eliminate configuration drift with version-controlled infrastructure and automated state management
- **📋 GitOps Integration**: Leverage Git workflows for infrastructure changes with full audit trails and rollback capabilities
- **🚀 Accelerated Delivery**: Reduce environment creation from days to hours with automated provisioning
- **🌐 Hybrid / Multi-cloud Ready**: Consistent provisioning across AWS, Azure, GCP, and on-premises environments
- **🔒 Policy as Code**: Enforce organizational standards through automated policy validation

## Core Concepts

### Fundamental Concepts

#### Concept 1: Declarative Infrastructure

Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC enables version control, testing, and automation of infrastructure changes.

**Key Points:**
- Infrastructure is defined in code files (Terraform HCL)
- Changes are version-controlled in Git repositories
- Infrastructure can be tested, reviewed, and deployed like application code
- Enables reproducible and consistent infrastructure across environments

**Example:**
```hcl
# Terraform example: Provision IBM Cloud VPC
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "retail_vpc" {
  name           = "retail-production-vpc"
  resource_group = ibm_resource_group.retail.id
  tags           = ["environment:production", "app:retail"]
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "retail_subnet" {
  name            = "retail-subnet-zone-1"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.retail_vpc.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}
```

#### Concept 2: State Management

Terraform maintains a state file that tracks the current state of managed infrastructure. This state is critical for determining what changes need to be applied and for preventing conflicts in team environments.

**Key Points:**
- State file maps real-world resources to configuration
- Enables drift detection (actual vs desired state)
- Supports remote state backends for team collaboration
- State locking prevents concurrent modifications
