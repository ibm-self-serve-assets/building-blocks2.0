# Application Performance

## Overview

Application Performance delivers intelligent, automated resource optimization that continuously balances application performance, infrastructure efficiency, and cost control using **IBM Turbonomic**—ensuring applications always receive precisely the resources they need across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

### What is Application Performance?

Modern enterprises face competing priorities: maintaining application performance while controlling infrastructure costs. Overprovisioning leads to wasted spend; underprovisioning risks performance degradation and SLA violations. Manual tuning cannot keep pace with dynamic workloads.

**IBM Turbonomic** eliminates this trade-off through Application Resource Management (ARM)—a closed-loop platform that analyzes application demand, resource consumption patterns, and infrastructure constraints in real time. It continuously makes and executes optimization decisions that ensure applications meet performance objectives with optimal efficiency, without human intervention.

Unlike traditional monitoring tools that generate alerts for humans to act on, Turbonomic actively *acts*—right-sizing containers, moving workloads, and adjusting resource allocations autonomously based on AI-driven analysis of actual demand.

### Why Application Performance?

- **⚡ Real-time Performance Assurance**: Maintain SLA compliance through continuous demand-driven resource allocation and proactive bottleneck prevention
- **💰 Cost Optimization**: Eliminate overprovisioning waste while ensuring applications have the resources needed for optimal performance
- **🤖 Operational Efficiency**: Automate scaling decisions and workload placement without manual intervention
- **📈 Infrastructure Maximization**: Improve container density and resource utilization across hybrid and multi-cloud environments
