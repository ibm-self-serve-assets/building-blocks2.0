# Multi-Agent Orchestration

## Overview

The **Multi-Agent Orchestration** building block enables multiple AI agents to collaborate intelligently to achieve complex enterprise workflows. Each agent specializes in a specific domain (e.g., HR, IT, Finance, Customer Support), while the orchestration runtime coordinates them using context sharing, task routing, and feedback loops.

## What It Does

- **Dynamic Task Delegation**: Automatically assigns subtasks to the most capable agent or external system
- **Shared Memory & Context**: Agents exchange structured knowledge through a unified memory layer
- **Chained Reasoning**: Combines reasoning outputs from multiple agents to form comprehensive responses
- **Goal-Driven Execution**: End-to-end orchestration from intent detection to action execution
- **External System Integration**: Extends orchestration beyond the platform via MCP and A2A servers

## Why Use It?

- ✅ **Interoperability**: Enable agents built on any framework to communicate and collaborate
- ✅ **Standardization**: Consistent interfaces using MCP and A2A open standards
- ✅ **Extensibility**: Future-proof architecture that adapts as agent technologies evolve
- ✅ **Security**: Secure communication and data handling between agents and systems

## Key Integration Standards

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Enables secure, two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools:

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
Enables AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate regardless of underlying technology:

## How to Use

### 1. Build Your Own Multi-Agent System
Follow best practices for designing and implementing multi-agent orchestration:
- Review the [Best Practice Guide](./assets/Best_Practice_Guide.md) for design patterns and guidelines
- Design agent collaboration architecture with clear responsibilities
- Implement MCP/A2A integration for external system connectivity
