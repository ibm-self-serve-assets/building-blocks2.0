## How Skills Work

### Automatic Activation
Bob automatically determines when to activate a skill based on:
- Your request content
- The skill's description
- The files you're working with

### Skill Structure
Each skill follows Bob's best practices:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Main skill file with YAML front matter
├── detailed-reference.md # Comprehensive examples (optional)
└── troubleshooting.md    # Common issues (optional)
```

### SKILL.md Format
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Clear description of when to use this skill
---

## Using Skills

### In Your Workflow
1. Start working on a task
2. Bob automatically activates relevant skills
3. Bob follows the skill's instructions
4. Refer to supporting files for detailed examples

### Manual Reference
You can also reference skills manually:
- Check `SKILL.md` for quick guidance
- Consult `detailed-reference.md` for comprehensive examples
- Review `troubleshooting.md` for common issues

## Skill Locations

Skills can be defined at two levels:

| Location | Scope | Use Case |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `.bob/skills/` | Project-specific | Workflows unique to this project |
| `~/.bob/skills/` | Global | Personal or organization-wide workflows |

**Priority:** Project-level skills take precedence over global skills with the same name.

## Best Practices

### Creating Skills
- **Clear descriptions** - Help Bob understand when to activate
- **Focused instructions** - Keep SKILL.md concise
- **Supporting files** - Move detailed content to separate files
- **Actionable steps** - Structure as clear, step-by-step instructions

### Using Skills
- **Trust automation** - Let Bob activate skills automatically
- **Reference documentation** - Use supporting files for details
- **Keep updated** - Update skills as patterns evolve
