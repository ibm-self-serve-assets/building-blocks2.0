- [ ] Tested channel integration
- [ ] Generated webchat embed (if applicable)

### Multi-Agent Systems
- [ ] Searched MCP docs for multi-agent patterns
- [ ] Designed agent hierarchy
- [ ] Created specialist agents first
- [ ] Parent agent has clear routing instructions
- [ ] Each specialist has focused responsibility
- [ ] Routing scenarios documented
- [ ] Tested collaboration flow

## Testing Checklist

### Component Testing
- [ ] Tested Python tools independently
- [ ] Tested agent with tools
- [ ] Tested knowledge base retrieval
- [ ] Tested multi-agent routing (if applicable)
- [ ] Tested channel integration

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Happy path - everything works
- [ ] Error handling - tool failures
- [ ] Edge cases - unexpected inputs
- [ ] Performance - response times
- [ ] Security - no data leakage

### Draft Environment Testing
- [ ] All assets imported to draft
- [ ] Tested in Orchestrate UI
- [ ] Tested with orchestrate chat ask
- [ ] Verified tool execution
- [ ] Verified KB retrieval
- [ ] Verified connection authentication
- [ ] All issues resolved

## Controls Gate Checklist

- [ ] Ran Controls Recommendation Engine (Phase 5.5) before presenting deliverables
- [ ] Analysed agent purpose, data sensitivity, and tools for control signals
- [ ] Presented specific named recommendations with reasons (not a generic yes/no)
- [ ] Used ✅ RECOMMENDED / ⚪ OPTIONAL format
- [ ] Waited for user response before proceeding
- [ ] If controls selected: generated `controls/` folder with one YAML per control
- [ ] If controls selected: used correct `spec_version: v1` / `artifact_name:` / `agent_names:` schema
- [ ] If controls selected: added `orchestrate controls import` lines to `deploy.sh`
- [ ] Did NOT embed controls in the agent YAML `plugins` field

## Deployment Checklist
