# Data Streaming Confluent Skill

A comprehensive BOB skill for creating production-ready Confluent Cloud streaming solutions with Infrastructure-as-Code, organized artifacts, and complete documentation.

## ⚠️ Important: Critical Configuration Requirements

**All generated solutions include these mandatory configurations to prevent deployment failures:**

1. **Schema Registry Timing**: 60-second wait for auto-provisioning after Kafka cluster creation
2. **API Key Environment Blocks**: All API keys include environment blocks in managed_resource
3. **Single Topic/Table Owner**: Never pre-create a Terraform topic and then try to redefine the same Flink inferred table
4. **Deterministic Continuous SQL**: No wall-clock/random functions in updating joins or upsert pipelines; use event time and stable business keys

These are automatically included in all generated Terraform configurations and Flink SQL. See SKILL.md for implementation details.

## Overview

This skill transforms business problems into **deployable streaming architectures** on Confluent Cloud, featuring:

- 🏗️ **Structured Artifact Organization** - Separate directories for code, scripts, docs, and configs
- 🎯 **Business Domain Focus** - Topics and schemas aligned with your business domain
- 🔄 **Repeatable Solutions** - Templates for common use cases (fraud detection, IoT, inventory)
- 🚀 **Production-Ready** - Terraform IaC with proper RBAC, security, and monitoring
- ✅ **End-to-End Testing** - Comprehensive validation queries and test procedures

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Describe Your Business Problem

Simply describe what you're trying to solve:

```
"I need to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. 
We process 10,000 transactions per minute and need to flag suspicious 
patterns within seconds."
```

Or:

```
"Build an IoT monitoring system for 500 temperature sensors across 
10 warehouses. Alert when temperature exceeds thresholds and track 
device connectivity."
```

### Step 2: Review Generated Solution

The skill will generate:
- Complete Terraform infrastructure
- Flink SQL for stream processing
- Python producers with sample data
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automation scripts

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
# One-command deployment
./scripts/setup.sh

# Or manual deployment
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply

cd ../python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Test

```bash
# Run test data
./scripts/test.sh

# Or manually
cd python
source venv/bin/activate
python producers/produce_messages.py
```

### Step 5: Validate

Use the provided Flink SQL queries in `docs/TESTING.md`:

```sql
-- Check raw stream
SELECT * FROM transactions LIMIT 10;

-- Check aggregated results
SELECT * FROM fraud_alerts ORDER BY alert_time DESC;

-- Check windowed aggregations
SELECT window_start, window_end, customer_id, COUNT(*) 
FROM TABLE(TUMBLE(TABLE transactions, DESCRIPTOR(transaction_time), INTERVAL '5' MINUTES))
GROUP BY window_start, window_end, customer_id;
```

### Step 6: Cleanup

```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

## Flink SQL Safety Update (2026-08-24)

The skill now treats Confluent Cloud Flink tables as first-class Kafka resources and enforces two rules that prevent common deployment failures:

- **One owner per stream:** new typed Flink streams are normally created with Flink `CREATE TABLE` and are not duplicated as Terraform `confluent_kafka_topic` resources. Existing/Terraform-owned topics use registered schemas plus inferred Flink tables.
- **Deterministic updating queries:** continuous jobs do not use `LOCALTIMESTAMP`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `NOW()`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`, `UUID()`, or random functions for keys, rule evaluation, or output timestamps when the query can emit updates/retractions. Event timestamps, source event IDs, business keys, and window boundaries are used instead.

Stateful joins are also reviewed for interval/window/temporal semantics or a documented state TTL, and `EXPLAIN` is part of validation.

## Technical Highlights

### Terraform Best Practices
- ✅ Confluent provider >= 2.68.0 (Flink support)
- ✅ Correct API key associations (Kafka, Flink, Schema Registry)
- ✅ Proper role bindings (CloudClusterAdmin, FlinkDeveloper, EnvironmentAdmin)
- ✅ RBAC propagation delays
- ✅ Auto-generated .env files

### Flink SQL Best Practices
- ✅ JSON Schema format for keys and values
- ✅ DISTRIBUTED BY for partitioning
- ✅ Key columns first in schema
- ✅ Consumer isolation level set
- ✅ Proper watermark configuration
- ✅ Table-Valued Function (TVF) syntax for windows

### Python Best Practices
- ✅ Schema Registry integration
- ✅ JSON Schema serialization
- ✅ Object keys (not strings)
- ✅ Millisecond timestamps
- ✅ Delivery callbacks
- ✅ Error handling

## Example: Fraud Detection Solution

### Business Problem
Detect fraudulent credit card transactions by analyzing transaction velocity and unusual patterns.

### Generated Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Transaction Source] --> B[transactions Topic]
    B --> C[Flink SQL Processing]
    C --> D[fraud-alerts Topic]
    D --> E[Alert System]
    
    C --> F[customer-profiles Topic]
    F --> C
```

### Generated Topics
- `transactions` - All credit card transactions
- `fraud-alerts` - Detected fraud cases with risk scores
- `customer-profiles` - Customer behavior baselines

### Generated Processing Logic
```sql
-- Calculate transaction velocity
INSERT INTO fraud_alerts
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  transaction_time as alert_time,
  'HIGH_VELOCITY' as alert_type,
  CAST(COUNT(*) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY transaction_time 
    RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '5' MINUTES PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS DECIMAL(5,2)) / 10.0 as risk_score
FROM transactions
WHERE COUNT(*) OVER (
  PARTITION BY customer_id 
  ORDER BY transaction_time 
  RANGE BETWEEN INTERVAL '5' MINUTES PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
) > 10;
```

### Generated Test Data
```json
[
  {
    "transaction_id": "TXN-001",
    "customer_id": "CUST-12345",
    "amount": 150.00,
    "merchant": "Online Store",
    "location": "US-CA",
    "transaction_time": 1704067200000
  }
]
```
