## Quick Start

### Step 1: Describe Your Business Problem

Simply tell the skill what you're trying to solve. Be specific about:
- **Domain**: What industry or business area?
- **Entities**: What are the key things you're tracking?
- **Events**: What happens that you need to process?
- **Goals**: What insights or actions do you need?

**Example:**
```
"Build a fraud detection system for credit card transactions. 
We process 10,000 transactions per minute and need to detect:
- High transaction velocity (>10 in 5 minutes)
- Unusual amounts (>$5000)
- Suspicious locations
Calculate risk scores and alert on high-risk transactions."
```

### Step 2: Review Generated Solution

The skill will generate a complete solution with:
- Terraform infrastructure files
- Flink SQL processing logic
- Python producers with sample data
- Comprehensive documentation
- Automation scripts

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Run setup
./scripts/setup.sh
```

### Step 4: Test

```bash
# Produce test data
./scripts/test.sh

# Validate with Flink SQL queries (see docs/TESTING.md)
```

### Step 5: Cleanup

```bash
# Remove all resources
./scripts/cleanup.sh
```

### Key Components

#### 1. Terraform Infrastructure (`terraform/`)

**What it creates:**
- Confluent Cloud environment
- Kafka cluster (Basic tier)
- Domain-specific topics
- Schema Registry (auto-provisioned)
- Flink compute pool
- Service accounts with proper RBAC
- API keys for Kafka, Flink, and Schema Registry

**Key files:**
- `main.tf` - All resource definitions
- `variables.tf` - Configurable parameters
- `outputs.tf` - Credentials and connection info
- `terraform.tfvars` - Your specific values (created from .example)

#### 2. Flink SQL Processing (`terraform/main.tf`)

**What it includes:**
- Source table definitions (input topics)
- Destination table definitions (output topics)
- Processing jobs (aggregations, filtering, joins)
- Proper schema registration

**Key patterns:**
- Windowed aggregations (TUMBLE, HOP)
- Stateful processing (GROUP BY)
- Stream joins with bounded-state strategy
- Filtering and transformations
- Deterministic sink IDs and event-time output timestamps

**Important Flink ownership rule:** If the solution uses Flink `CREATE TABLE` for a new typed stream, do not also create the same topic with Terraform. If Terraform owns an existing topic, register its schemas first and use the inferred Flink table instead of re-running `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`.

**Important determinism rule:** Continuous jobs that can emit updates/retractions must not use wall-clock/random functions such as `LOCALTIMESTAMP`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `NOW()`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`, or `UUID()` for keys, output timestamps, severity/status logic, or predicates. Use source event time, source event IDs, business keys, or window boundaries.

#### 3. Python Producers (`python/`)

**What it provides:**
- Schema-aware message production
- Sample data generation
- Error handling and monitoring
- Delivery callbacks

**Key features:**
- Retrieves schemas from Schema Registry
- Uses JSON Schema serialization
- Proper key/value formatting
- Timestamp handling (milliseconds)

#### 4. Documentation (`docs/`)

**What it contains:**
- Architecture diagrams (Mermaid)
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Testing procedures with SQL queries
- Troubleshooting guides
- Cleanup procedures

#### 5. Automation Scripts (`scripts/`)

**What they do:**
- `setup.sh` - Complete deployment automation
- `test.sh` - Produce test data
- `cleanup.sh` - Safe resource removal

## Deployment Workflow

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. **Confluent Cloud Account**
   - Sign up at https://confluent.cloud
   - Create Cloud API key and secret
   - Note your organization ID

2. **Local Tools**
   - Terraform >= 1.0
   - Python >= 3.8
   - pip3
   - bash shell

3. **Credentials**
   - Confluent Cloud API key
   - Confluent Cloud API secret

### Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# 2. Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# The script will:
# - Check prerequisites
# - Create terraform.tfvars from example
# - Prompt for credentials
# - Deploy infrastructure
# - Setup Python environment
# - Verify configuration
```

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Configure Terraform
cd terraform
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your credentials

# 2. Deploy infrastructure
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply

# 3. Setup Python
cd ../python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Verify .env file was created
cat .env
```

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. **Confluent Cloud Console**
   - Environment created
   - Cluster running
   - Topics created
   - Flink compute pool active

2. **Local Configuration**
   - `.env` file exists in `python/`
   - Contains all required variables
   - No placeholder values

3. **RBAC Permissions**
   - Wait 30 seconds after deployment
   - Permissions need time to propagate

---

## Testing and Validation

### Producing Test Data

```bash
# Using automation script
./scripts/test.sh

# Or manually
cd python
source venv/bin/activate
python producers/produce_messages.py
```

### Validating Results

#### 1. Check Raw Stream

```sql
-- View recent messages
SELECT * FROM source_table 
ORDER BY timestamp_column DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Messages are flowing
- ✅ Schema is correct
- ✅ Timestamps are recent
- ✅ Data looks realistic

#### 2. Check Aggregated Results

```sql
-- View processed results
SELECT * FROM destination_table 
ORDER BY key_column 
LIMIT 20;
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Aggregations are correct
- ✅ Keys are properly set
- ✅ Values match expectations
- ✅ No duplicate keys (for upsert tables)

#### 3. Check Windowed Aggregations

```sql
-- View time-based windows
SELECT 
  window_start,
  window_end,
  key_column,
  aggregated_value
FROM windowed_table
ORDER BY window_start DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Windows are correct size
- ✅ Aggregations within windows are correct
- ✅ No missing windows
- ✅ Watermarks advancing properly

#### 4. Check Business Logic

```sql
-- Verify specific business rules
SELECT * FROM alerts_table
WHERE severity = 'HIGH'
ORDER BY alert_time DESC;
```

**What to verify:**
- ✅ Alerts triggered correctly
- ✅ Thresholds working
- ✅ Business rules applied
- ✅ No false positives/negatives

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Flink Statement Fails Determinism Validation

**Typical error:** `generated by non-deterministic function ... can not satisfy the determinism requirement for correctly processing update message`.

**Why it happens:** keyed sources, joins, filters, and aggregations can produce update/retraction changelogs. Dynamic functions such as `LOCALTIMESTAMP`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `NOW()`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP()`, and `UUID()` can return a different value when Flink reprocesses the same logical row.

**Fix:**
- derive IDs from stable business/source-event keys;
- derive `detected_at`/`assessed_at` from source event time or window boundaries;
- evaluate deadline rules relative to a relevant event timestamp;
- use an explicit heartbeat/tick stream or event-time timer pattern when a rule must fire solely because wall-clock time passed;
- run `EXPLAIN` and review changelog/determinism warnings before `terraform apply`.

Do not replace one current-time function with another; that does not solve the underlying problem.

#### No Data in Destination Table

**Possible causes:**
1. RBAC permissions not propagated (wait 30s)
2. Flink job not running (check Console)
3. Consumer isolation level not set
4. Schema mismatch

**Solutions:**
```sql
-- Check if source has data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table;

-- Check Flink job status in Console
-- Wait 30 seconds after deployment
-- Verify consumer isolation level in table definition
```

#### Windowed Aggregations Not Triggering

**Possible causes:**
1. Watermark not advancing
2. Events not aligned to window boundaries
3. Not enough events to close window

**Solutions:**
- Produce events after window end time
- Align test data to window boundaries
- Check watermark configuration

## Customization

### Modifying Topic Configuration

Before editing Terraform, identify the stream owner. Only Terraform-owned/existing topics should have `confluent_kafka_topic` resources. A stream created by Flink `CREATE TABLE` must not also be managed as a Terraform topic of the same name.

For Terraform-owned topics, edit `terraform/main.tf`:

```hcl
# Change partition count
resource "confluent_kafka_topic" "my_topic" {
  # ...
  partitions_count = 6  # Change from default 4
}

# Add retention policy
resource "confluent_kafka_topic" "my_topic" {
  # ...
  config = {
    "retention.ms" = "604800000"  # 7 days
  }
}
```

### Adding New Flink Jobs

Add to `terraform/main.tf`:

```hcl
resource "confluent_flink_statement" "my_new_job" {
  # Copy structure from existing jobs
  statement = <<-SQL
    INSERT INTO destination
    SELECT ...
    FROM source
    WHERE ...
  SQL
  
  # Same properties, credentials, depends_on as other jobs
}
```

### Modifying Sample Data

Edit `python/sample-data/*.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "key_field": "new_value",
    "other_field": "updated_value",
    "timestamp": 1704067200000
  }
]
```

### Adding New Producers

Create `python/producers/my_producer.py`:

```python
# Copy structure from existing producer
# Modify schema retrieval
# Adjust message generation logic
```

## Troubleshooting

### Terraform Issues

#### Error: Invalid API credentials
```
Solution: Verify api_key and api_secret in terraform.tfvars
```

#### Error: Resource already exists
```
Solution: 
1. Check if resources exist in Console
2. Import existing resources or delete them
3. Run terraform apply again
```

#### Error: RBAC permissions denied
```
Solution:
1. Wait 30 seconds after role binding creation
2. Verify service account has correct roles
3. Check time_sleep resource is in depends_on
```

### Flink SQL Issues

#### Error: Table not found
```
Solution:
1. Verify table creation statement succeeded
2. Check sql.current-catalog and sql.current-database
3. Ensure proper depends_on chain
```

#### Error: Schema mismatch
```
Solution:
1. Check Schema Registry for registered schemas
2. Verify key and value formats match
3. Ensure producer uses same schema
```

### Python Producer Issues

#### Error: Schema not found
```
Solution:
1. Verify Flink tables created (they register schemas)
2. Check Schema Registry credentials in .env
3. Ensure schema name matches topic name
```

#### Error: Authentication failed
```
Solution:
1. Verify KAFKA_API_KEY and KAFKA_API_SECRET in .env
2. Check bootstrap servers format (no SASL_SSL:// prefix)
3. Ensure API key has CloudClusterAdmin role
```
