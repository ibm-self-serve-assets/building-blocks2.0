## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables before running the playbook:

```bash
export OC_URL="https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443"
export OC_TOKEN="your-openshift-token"
export DOCKER_USERNAME="your-dockerhub-username"
export DOCKER_PASSWORD="your-dockerhub-password"
```

For production deployments, also set:

```bash
export JWT_SECRET="your-production-jwt-secret"
export DB_PASSWORD="your-production-db-password"
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Edit the appropriate file in `group_vars/` to customize your deployment:

- `group_vars/development.yml` - Development environment settings
- `group_vars/test.yml` - Test environment settings
- `group_vars/production.yml` - Production environment settings

Key configuration parameters:

```yaml
# Environment and namespace
environment: development
namespace: retail-dev

# OpenShift cluster (now from environment variable)
openshift_server: "{{ lookup('env', 'OC_URL') }}"

# Image tags
backend_image_tag: "1.0.0-dev"
frontend_image_tag: "1.0.0-dev"

# Replica counts
backend_replicas: 1
frontend_replicas: 1

# Resource limits
backend_cpu_request: "50m"
backend_memory_request: "64Mi"
backend_cpu_limit: "250m"
backend_memory_limit: "256Mi"
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ansible-retail-bob
   ```

2. **Set environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export OC_URL="https://api.your-cluster.example.com:6443"
   export OC_TOKEN="your-openshift-token"
   export DOCKER_USERNAME="your-dockerhub-username"
   export DOCKER_PASSWORD="your-dockerhub-password"
   ```

3. **Run the deployment:**
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml
   ```

### Deployment Commands

#### Development Environment
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml
```

#### Test Environment
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/test/hosts playbooks/deploy-test.yml
```

#### Production Environment
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories/production/hosts playbooks/deploy-production.yml
```

### Using Tags

Run specific parts of the deployment:

```bash
# Only install dependencies
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml --tags dependencies

# Only build and push images
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml --tags images

# Only deploy application (skip setup)
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml --tags deploy

# Skip database seeding
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml --skip-tags seed
```

Available tags:
- `dependencies` - System dependencies installation
- `setup` - Setup tasks (dependencies, source, OpenShift)
- `source` - Application source code management
- `images` - Container image building
- `build` - Build-related tasks
- `openshift` - OpenShift authentication and setup
- `manifests` - Kubernetes manifest updates
- `config` - Configuration tasks
- `deploy` - Application deployment
- `application` - Application-specific tasks
- `database` - Database operations
- `seed` - Database seed data loading
- `frontend` - Frontend operations
- `rebuild` - Frontend rebuild

### Rollback Failed Deployments

If a deployment fails or causes issues, use the rollback playbook:

```bash
# Rollback development environment
ansible-playbook playbooks/rollback.yml -e env_name=development

# Rollback test environment
ansible-playbook playbooks/rollback.yml -e env_name=test

# Rollback production environment
ansible-playbook playbooks/rollback.yml -e env_name=production
```

The rollback playbook will:
- Roll back backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL deployments to previous revision
- Wait for rollback completion
- Display status of all components
- Fail gracefully if no previous revision exists

## Performance Enhancements

This deployment includes several performance and reliability enhancements:

### Parallel Image Building
Images are built concurrently, reducing build time by 40-60%:
```bash
# All three images (backend, frontend, postgres) build simultaneously
```

### Automatic Retry Logic
Network operations automatically retry on failure:
- Docker Hub login: 3 retries with 5-second delays
- Image push: 3 retries with 10-second delays
- Database operations: 2 retries with 10-second delays

### Health Check Verification
Backend health endpoint is verified after deployment:
- Endpoint: `{{ backend_route }}/health`
- Retries: 5 attempts with 10-second delays
- Non-blocking: Continues even if health check fails

### Build Metrics
Track deployment performance:
- Build duration displayed in summary
- Seed duration displayed in summary
- Helps identify performance bottlenecks

### Automatic Cleanup
Dangling images are automatically removed after build (can be disabled with `cleanup_images: false`)

For detailed information about all enhancements, see [ENHANCEMENTS.md](ENHANCEMENTS.md)

## Multi-Environment Support

This automation supports multiple environments with the same codebase. Differences are managed through:

1. **Inventory Files**: Separate inventory for each environment
2. **Group Variables**: Environment-specific configurations in `group_vars/`
3. **Environment-Specific Playbooks**: Convenience playbooks for each environment

### Environment Differences

| Feature | Development | Test | Production |
|---------|-------------|------|------------|
| Namespace | retail-dev | retail-test | retail-prod |
| Replicas | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| CPU Request | 50m | 100m | 200m |
| Memory Request | 64Mi | 128Mi | 256Mi |
| CPU Limit | 250m | 500m | 1000m |
| Memory Limit | 256Mi | 512Mi | 1Gi |
| Image Tag | 1.0.0-dev | 1.0.0-test | 1.0.0 |

### Adding a New Environment

1. Create inventory file: `inventories/staging/hosts`
2. Create variables file: `group_vars/staging.yml`
3. Create playbook: `playbooks/deploy-staging.yml`
4. Update configurations as needed

## Roles Description

### system_dependencies
Installs all required system dependencies including Podman, Java 11, OpenShift CLI, and Apache JMeter.

### app_source
Clones the Retail application source code from GitHub and verifies the repository structure.

### container_images
Builds container images for backend, frontend, and PostgreSQL, then pushes them to Docker Hub.

### openshift_setup
Authenticates to the OpenShift cluster, creates/verifies the namespace, and sets up Docker Hub image pull secrets.

### k8s_manifests
Updates Kubernetes manifests with environment-specific values including namespace, image references, and resource limits.

### app_deployment
Deploys all application components to OpenShift including PostgreSQL, backend, frontend, services, routes, and HPAs.

### database_seed
Loads the database seed data (full_dump.sql) into the PostgreSQL database.

### frontend_rebuild
Rebuilds the frontend container image with the correct backend route URL and redeploys it.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Authentication Failures

**Problem**: OpenShift login fails
```
Solution: Verify your OC_TOKEN is valid and has not expired
```

#### 2. Image Push Failures

**Problem**: Cannot push images to Docker Hub
```
Solution: 
- Verify DOCKER_USERNAME and DOCKER_PASSWORD are correct
- Check Docker Hub repository exists and you have push permissions
- Ensure you're logged in: podman login docker.io
```

#### 3. Pod Not Starting

**Problem**: Pods remain in Pending or CrashLoopBackOff state
```
Solution:
- Check pod logs: oc logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
- Check events: oc get events -n <namespace>
- Verify image pull secret: oc get secret dockerhub-secret -n <namespace>
- Check resource quotas: oc describe quota -n <namespace>
```

#### 4. Database Connection Issues

**Problem**: Backend cannot connect to database
```
Solution:
- Verify PostgreSQL pod is running: oc get pods -n <namespace>
- Check PostgreSQL service: oc get svc retail-postgres -n <namespace>
- Verify database credentials in backend deployment
- Check backend logs for connection errors
```

#### 5. Frontend Cannot Reach Backend

**Problem**: Frontend shows API connection errors
```
Solution:
- Verify backend route exists: oc get route retail-backend -n <namespace>
- Check if frontend was rebuilt with correct backend URL
- Verify backend pods are ready and responding
- Check CORS configuration in backend
```

### Debug Mode

Run with verbose output:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-development.yml -vvv
```

### Checking Deployment Status

```bash
# Check all pods
oc get pods -n retail-dev

# Check services
oc get svc -n retail-dev

# Check routes
oc get routes -n retail-dev

# Check pod logs
oc logs -f deployment/retail-backend -n retail-dev
oc logs -f deployment/retail-frontend -n retail-dev

# Check pod details
oc describe pod <pod-name> -n retail-dev
```

### Cleanup

To remove the deployment:
```bash
# Delete all resources in namespace
oc delete all --all -n retail-dev

# Delete namespace
oc delete namespace retail-dev
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always test in development first** before deploying to production
2. **Use version control** for configuration changes
3. **Keep secrets secure** - never commit credentials to Git
4. **Monitor deployments** - check logs and metrics after deployment
5. **Backup production data** before major updates
6. **Use tags** to run specific parts of the deployment during troubleshooting
7. **Document changes** to environment-specific configurations
