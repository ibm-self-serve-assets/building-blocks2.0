# Agent Ops

AI agents don't behave like traditional software — they can respond differently every time. That makes them harder to test, trust, and troubleshoot.

**Agent Ops** is a framework for testing, monitoring, and improving AI agents, from development through production.

![Evaluate, observe, and optimize your agents using the Agent Ops Building Block](../model-evaluation/gen-ai-evaluations/assets/evaluation-scripts/images/Agent%20Ops%20Evaluation-2026-04-21-220937_150.png)

## Key Highlights

- Catch failures before deployment, and keep monitoring your agents in production
- Automated testing with simulated users — no manual QA bottleneck
- Built-in security testing against 15 adversarial attack types
- Go from user stories to test suites in minutes, not days
- Full cost and performance visibility per agent interaction

## Solves For

- Agents that don't work as expected
- Hard-to-diagnose failures
- Slow, manual testing cycles
- Unpredictable cost and latency

## Capabilities at a Glance

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Evaluate** | Simulate real users at scale to verify the agent does what it's supposed to do |
| **Analyze** | Pinpoint exactly where and why an agent went wrong |
| **Quick-Eval** | Fast sanity check — catch structural issues early without writing full test cases |
| **Generate** | Turn plain-English user stories into automated test scenarios |
| **Red-Team** | Stress-test agent security against prompt injection, social engineering, and jailbreaking |
| **Observe** | Track cost, latency, and token usage per interaction with full traceability |

## What's Inside

### [Assets](assets/)
Production-ready Python package for evaluating AI agents and RAG applications using IBM watsonx governance metrics. Includes support for basic RAG, advanced RAG, and tool-calling agent evaluations.

### [Bob Modes](bob-modes/)
Guided AI-assisted workflows for automated agent evaluation — LLM-simulated conversations, tool-calling precision/recall, RAG faithfulness scoring, and adversarial red-teaming.
